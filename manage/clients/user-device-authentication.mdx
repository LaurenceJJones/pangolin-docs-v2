User device authentication controls how people sign in to Pangolin clients and establish trusted sessions on desktop and mobile devices.

Use this page to understand sign-in behavior, multi-factor prompts, and what to check when authentication fails.

## Supported Authentication Methods

- Pangolin account login
- External identity provider login (for example OIDC/SAML setups configured by your organization)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA), including authenticator app and passkey/security key flows when enabled

## How Authentication Works

1. Install and open the Pangolin client on your device.
2. Start the login flow from the client UI.
3. Authenticate with your configured provider.
4. Complete any required MFA challenge.
5. Return to the client to finish session establishment.

After successful authentication, the client establishes a session tied to your organization and device context.

## Session Behavior

- Sessions can expire based on your organization policies.
- Re-authentication may be required after session expiry, policy changes, or account security events.
- If your organization enforces stronger controls, additional prompts can appear during sign-in.

For admin-side policy controls, see [Session Length](/manage/access-control/session-length).

## MFA and Security Keys

- If MFA is enabled for your account or organization, the client login flow requires a second factor.
- Supported second-factor methods depend on your account setup and organization policy.
- Security keys/passkeys are supported when configured in your account and accepted by the active identity flow.

For setup and policy details, see [Multi-Factor Authentication](/manage/access-control/mfa) and [Security Keys](/manage/access-control/security-keys).

## Common Authentication Issues

### Login Succeeds in Browser but Client Does Not Connect

- Re-open the client and retry login.
- Confirm your device can reach your Pangolin endpoint.
- Verify system clock/timezone is correct.

### Repeated MFA Prompts

- Check whether your organization enforces short session durations.
- Confirm the selected MFA method is available and correctly configured on your account.

### Identity Provider Error During Sign-In

- Confirm your user is assigned in the identity provider.
- Verify organization IdP configuration and callback settings.
- Retry from a fresh login attempt in the client.

### Access Denied After Login

- Confirm your user has required permissions and role assignments.
- Review access rules on the target application/resource.
