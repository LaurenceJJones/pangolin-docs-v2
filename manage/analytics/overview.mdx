The Analytics area gives you a high-level view of how your resources are being used so you can monitor health, detect anomalies, and understand usage patterns over time.

Use this section alongside [Logs](/manage/analytics/request) when you need detailed, event-level data for troubleshooting or audits.

## What Analytics Helps With

- Understanding request and access trends
- Spotting unusual traffic patterns
- Reviewing usage by resource, actor, or timeframe
- Correlating operational changes with behavior shifts
