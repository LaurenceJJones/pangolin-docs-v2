!TODO: Expand this scaffold page with complete product documentation.

Links let you generate shareable access URLs for an application, so you can provide controlled access without changing your core resource configuration.

## What You Can Do

- Create a shareable link for an application
- Review existing links and their purpose
- Revoke links when they are no longer needed

## Current Behavior

- Links can be temporary and configured to expire
- Links can also be created without expiration, depending on your access model
- Link-based access is designed for controlled sharing to a resource

## Important Notes

- Shareable links are documented under [Resource Authentication](/manage/resources/public/authentication#shareable-links-and-access-tokens)
- Link-based access does not provide per-user identity headers to upstream apps. See [Forwarded Headers](/manage/access-control/forwarded-headers)

## Notes

This page is a scaffold and will be expanded with detailed behavior, security considerations, and examples.
