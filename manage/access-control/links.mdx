Links let you generate shareable URLs for a resource, so you can grant controlled access without changing core resource configuration.

## Managing Existing Links

The **Manage Share Links** page is the primary place to create, review, and revoke links.

Available controls in this view include:

- **Create Share Link** to open link creation
- **Refresh** to reload the table and pull links created or updated by other users in your organization
- Search to quickly find links
- Sortable table columns (for example **Title**, **Resource**, **Created**, **Expires**)
- Pagination controls for navigating larger link sets

Use this list to:

- Review which links exist and what they are used for
- Confirm which links are active or expired
- Track when links were created and when they expire
- Revoke links when access should end

To revoke a link or its access token, delete the link from **Manage Share Links**.

## Create a Share Link

Click **Create Share Link** on the Manage Share Links page, then:

1. Select the target **Resource**.
2. Optionally set a **Title**.
3. Set **Expire In**:
   - Choose a time unit: Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months, or Years
   - Enter the duration value (for example, `30`)
4. If needed, enable **Never expire**.
5. Click **Create Link**.

Anyone with the link can access the resource, so treat share links like credentials.

## After You Create a Link

After creation, Pangolin shows a result screen with the generated link and token details.

- The link is shown once, so copy it immediately.
- A QR code is provided for quick sharing to mobile devices.
- You can copy the direct share URL from the modal.
- Token metadata (such as token ID and token value) is shown for integration use.

## Access Token Usage

The modal includes an **Access Token Usage** section that shows how to pass the token:

- As a query parameter
- As a request header

For authenticated access, include the token on client requests using your selected method.

<Warning>
Keep access tokens private. Do not share them in public channels or embed them in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Expiration Behavior

- Expiring links are valid only for the configured duration.
- When a link expires, it is removed and users who relied on it lose access.
- If **Never expire** is enabled, the link remains valid until you revoke it.

## Recommended Practices

- Default to short expirations.
- Use clear, descriptive titles.
- Create separate links per team or use case.
- Revoke links you no longer need.
- Do not share long-lived links in public channels.

## Important Notes

- For broader auth options, see [Resource Authentication](/manage/resources/public/authentication#shareable-links-and-access-tokens)
- Link-based access does not provide per-user identity headers to upstream apps. See [Forwarded Headers](/manage/access-control/forwarded-headers)
